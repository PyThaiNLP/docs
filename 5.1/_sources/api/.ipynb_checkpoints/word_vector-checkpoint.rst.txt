.. currentmodule:: pythainlp.word_vector

pythainlp.word_vector
=======================
The :class:`word_vector` contains functions that makes use of a pre-trained vector public data.
The `pythainlp.word_vector` module is a valuable resource for working with pre-trained word vectors. These word vectors are trained on large corpora and can be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as word similarity, document similarity, and more.

Dependencies
------------
Installation of :mod:`numpy` and :mod:`gensim` is required.

Before using this module, you need to ensure that the `numpy` and `gensim` libraries are installed in your environment. These libraries are essential for loading and working with the pre-trained word vectors.

Modules
